## Overview
 
Whether a job ad, graduate school application requirements, or guidelines for applying to a service program, the process of figuring out what recruiters or readers are looking for in your materials may appear to be a contest in mind-reading. It's clear that these documents are asking you to prove that your history, skills, and experience are the right combination of _something_, but what does that mean?

You can think of job listings as plot sketches for short stories about what a given organization does and what it thinks it is. This is more than just the specific industry, skills, or qualifications listed -- this also involes how a given company, school, or organization talks about _itself_.

And, just as you are in control of your version of your career narrative and how you tell it, you possess equal agency in job or graduate school searches. In essence, you're looking for a place that you think continues your story. You just need to find it. Easy, right?

Unfortunately, not so.

This exercise will help you start the process of finding and understanding what the employment landscape looks like for the various options you might be considering.
